# Intern Task  
My task was to create a .NET console application that returns filtered data. The application was suppossed to receive a list of NBA players (json file) and filter criteria and then to generate a file that contains only the players that satisfy the provided filters.  

## Example inputs 
You can try it out with two different approaches:   
````
data.json 10 90 test.csv
````
will generate the results csv file ("test") in the bin/Debug folder   

````
D:\Users\user\Desktop\data.json 10 92 D:\Users\user\Desktop\test1.csv
````
will generate the results csv file ("test1") in your desired path (hence here it is the Desktop)
